T_ShipLog1,(There's data log buried in the sand.) Log 1:  I made it all the way to sector A2. Over 1000 nautical miles. No one's been to this sector.
T_ShipLog3,Log 3:  I discovered the ruins of some civilization today. Why would there be ruins this far underwater? How are they preserved so well?
T_ShipLog4,Log 4: The power stations they have me building are a horrible design. Why are they radiating this much heat? So inefficient.
T_ShipLog2,Log 2: Something must be wrong with my equipment. The scans say these ruins are only about 50 years old?
